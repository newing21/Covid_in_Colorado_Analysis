# Covid_in_Colorado_Analysis
Project Introduction

The coronavirus outbreak, first identified by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in December of 2019, has since extended to every corner of the globe, killing more than 1.6 million and sickening more than 71 million in a matter of months [2].  According to CNN’s live coronavirus tracking dashboard, the United States alone has reported over 16 million confirmed cases, earning condemnation as a global hotspot.  

Although the coronavirus has devastated families across the nation, in the United States, minority groups have disproportionately suffered from health impacts and socioeconomic factors.  Health factors that contribute to greater risk from coronavirus, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity are more rampant in minority communities, reducing the ability of certain populations to cope with the impact of the pandemic [3].  

The goal of this project is to analyze how socioeconomic factors impact positive cases and rates of Covid-19 infection and will serve as a case study to identify if lapse in health care coverage exist for low-income, underserved communities in Colorado.  As a new resident of the state of Colorado, this project will provide invaluable insight into the challenges faced by large swaths of the community.  In addition, this project will enable me to identify the areas and neighborhoods most heavily impacted by the pandemic.  

To conduct this investigation, I seek to answer:

•	Counties with the highest number of confirmed cases?
•	Counties with the largest land mass?
•	Which counties have the largest percentage of black residents?
•	How do Income Levels Impact COVID-19 Positivity Rates?
•	What are the most popular stores in Denver?
•	What is the relationship between store type, city, and percent of black resident deaths in the area?

While this personal project serves as a method to familiarize myself with the area, extensions of this project can be employed by the State to administer and expand health care coverage.  Such analysis can be used to identify areas disproportionately impacted by disease, and policy can be devised to help mitigate the issues.
